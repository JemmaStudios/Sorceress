# Sorceress
X-plane 11 version of the Beck-Mahoney Sorceress.  A champion biplane racer from the 1970's.

Alpha 1.0.0
Aircraft flies.
Try the new (and very alpha) Jemma Studios "FlexDash" system. You can show/hide 3 1/8" or 2 1/4" versions of 5 different instruments and switch banks and also move them around the dash, to configure the cockpit instruments as you see fit.  Remember to SAVE the configuration after moving things around.  If you are wondering why there is a RELOAD INSTRUMENTS, it's so you can edit the flexdash.json file manually and load the changes into the cockpit.

To close the canopy, click on the handle (behind your head).  Remember to lock the canopy with the red handle.

Quick start guide:
Mixture Rich
Turn on Battery
Turn on Magneto 1
Turn on Magento 2
Hold the Starter switch up until the engine catches.

This aircraft is quite challenging to keep pointed straight on your takeoff roll.  Be prepared for some tricky rudder work before rotation.  The aircraft has no flaps so landing needs to be set up early so you are slowed down enough coming over the threshold.

Know Issues:
- No stick, throttle quadrant or other cockpit controls.
- Interior and Exterior textures still need tons of work.
- Cannot move the FlexDash compass instruments (you can just choose between the 3 1/4" & 2 1/8" version for now)
